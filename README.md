# Unit [![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/dwyl/esta/issues) [![Travis](https://img.shields.io/travis/rust-lang/rust.svg)]() [![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.1.1--aplha-orange.svg)]()
A genuinely open-source calculator
### Key features
* In the Menu Bar and under the View submenu you can toggle between different size/layout windows that yield different features:
  1. Minimal - Simple box that shows only the text(still functions, just use keyboard and press Enter to submit) but allows you to resize so its wider
  2. Basic - The default view for the app to launch in, its simple and has all of the basic functions you need to solve your problems
  3. Expressions - Adds four more buttons to the basic calculator, being: parentheses, carrot, and root
  4. Full - This view has all of the previous views features and a log for previous data
* The calculator uses Math.js so you can use more complicated syntax such as `sqrt()` for finding the square root, for using `sin()` `cos()` & `tan()` for trig.
* Of course because it's open-source you can edit the colors easily, see more about code edits in 'Editing the code!' section.

### Features that aren't so key
* The whole title bar is draggable (all of the dark blue, minus area close to your text).
* Takes almost no computing power from the CPU to run.
* It isn't the most buggy thing I've seen, I'm not saying theres not bugs, just not a lot... If you do spot one please post an issue to this GitHub page so I can adress the problem for a future release.
* It looks pretty nice... right? I'll count that as a feature.

### First release
This is the first release of the Unit app only for OS X for now, Theres still a few kinks that need to be worked out for Windows I'm sure.
### For OS X
Double click to unzip then right click and choose open.
### Editing the code!
Yes, this is the fun part! You guys can right click and click 'show package contents' and dig through until you find a folder called 'app' `Unit.app/Contents/Resources/app`(sorry I took the fun out of it) and that is all of the source code to the project! Feel free to mess with it, if anything ever goes wrong just re-download it from this GitHub page.
